<h3>THE ATHEIST</h3>


<p>"I worship no one," cried the atheist. "Divinities are senseless,
useless, barriers to progress and ambition, a curse to man. Gods,
fetiches, graven images, idols&mdash;faugh!"</p>

<p>On the atheist's work-table stood the photograph of a beautiful girl.</p>

<p>The Devil, finishing his seidel of W&uuml;rzburger, eyed the young man
quizzically.</p>

<p>"What would you of me?" he said.</p>

<p>"I would ask," bade the young man, "how one may know the women who serve
you as allies?"</p>

<p>"Find those who smile at themselves in their mirrors," said the Devil.</p>

<h3>THE MISTAKE</h3>


<p>He was the happiest man in the world, and the most successful in all
things. In his eyes was ever a smile; on his lips ever a song.</p>

<p>For the gods had made an awful mistake when they bore him into the
world. They had placed his heart in his head, where his brain should
have been, and his brain in his bosom, where his heart should have
been.</p>

<h3>TEMPORA MUTANTUR</h3>


<p>They couldn't understand why he married her, but the ironic little gods
who have such matters in hand knew it was because she had a little way
of swallowing before speaking, because she had a little way, when she
came to him and saw him standing there with arms open to clasp her tight
and kiss her, of sweeping her hat off and sailing it across the room,
because she had a way of twining her little fingers in his.</p>

<h3>LOVE</h3>


<p>They showed her a nest swarming with impostures, deceits, lies,
affectations, bitternesses, low desires, simulations, suspicions,
distrusts, cheatings, hates, delusions, distortions, evasions. And she
shrank from the sight of it as she looked close. But presently, when she
turned from a distance of a dozen paces and looked back, she saw a
brilliant-hued, beautiful bird soar from the nest and alight among the
flowers.</p>

<p>"What is that gorgeous bird?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Love," they told her.</p>

<h3>FLIPPANCY</h3>


<p>The scholar spoke to the mob in his own language and the mob heard him
not.</p>

<p>The scholar, that he might make himself understood to the mob, expressed
himself then in rune and jingle.</p>

<p>"A wise man and one who speaks the truth," quoth the mob, "but it is a
pity he is so flippant."</p>

<h3>THE INTRUDER</h3>


<p>It was moonlight in the court yard where languished among the flowers a
lover and his mistress.</p>

<p>The lover, presently, and for the first time since he had known his fair
lady, felt Wit flying close to his lips.</p>

<p>The little god of Love who had dwelt with the lovers in the court yard
since first they had come there, sensing the flutter of the intruder's
wings, took to his heels and slid between the bars of the great bronze
gate into a neighbouring garden.</p>

<h3>MEMORY</h3>


<p>Memory, wandering back over the great highway of the years, paused by
the wayside to gather some of the flowers that embroidered the road.
While Memory so bent himself, there confronted him suddenly a young
woman, and Memory saw there were tears in her eyes. "Who are you?" asked
Memory, for though about the young woman there was something vaguely he
knew, he could not recall her.</p>

<p>Through her tears the young woman looked at him and said, "Of all of us
you knew, me alone you have forgotten and do not remember. I am the
woman who truly loved you."</p>

who were wise and women who were gentle and women who were serious with
the grave problems of life&mdash;the pick of the women of all the great
kingdom who best were suited to the king.... Solomon, weighing
studiously the merits of each and pondering the one whom he might most
appropriately take unto him as best fitted for wife and mother, suddenly
caught sight, on the far edge of the crowd, of a little flower girl with
a cunning dimple in her ear....</p>

<p>An artist, wandering along the highway of a city, with his eyes on the

<h3>DRAMATIC CRITICISM</h3>


<p>Two gentlemen of the assizes met one evening upon the highway with a
dog. The dog, a friendly creature, barked amiably at the gentlemen,
whereupon the twain smiled and bent to pat the dog. Stooping thus, one
of the gentlemen issued suddenly a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>"Fie!" he cried to his colleague, "I see upon the creature's hide a
flea!"</p>

<p>The other adjusted his glass and scrutinized the beast closely.</p>

<p>"That," he observed, with the mien of one not to be contradicted, "that,
sir, is not a flea. That is a louse!"</p>

<p>"I think I'll take a few drinks to make me forget my troubles," said the

<p>The drinks made the poor man forget his troubles and filled him instead
with delightful visions of sunny lands and blue skies and red poppies
and fair women and languorous luxury.</p>

<p>And the poor man, now unhappier than before, had to expend his last
three sous for spirits of ammonia wherewith to recapture the nepenthe of
his first troubles.</p>

<h3>THE ACTOR</h3>


<p>A poet, poor and neglected, lived up under the dusty eaves, with for
sole companion a parrot. One day, the poet evolved a particularly lovely
line and, in his happiness, repeated it to himself aloud, and time upon
time.</p>

<p>A week later, some portly persons, passing beneath the lofty window,
espied the parrot perched upon the sill and heard it speak the poet's
line. Breathless with amazement, they stopped and cried out: "What a
<i>wonderful</i> bird!"</p>

sighed.</p>

<h3>IMITATIONS</h3>


<p>Resplendent in silks and furs and a marvelous necklace of diamonds, she

galleries.</p>

<p>The people in the great opera house whispered to one another that the
marvelous necklace of diamonds was unquestionably an imitation.
"Somehow," they said, "it looks like one." But they were wrong. The
necklace of diamonds was quite genuine. It was not the necklace of
diamonds, but the lady that was the imitation.</p>

remained.</p>

written, or tried to write, a poem?"</p>

<p>"No, your majesty," replied the fellow.</p>

<p>Said the king to the second of these, "Can you sit in a rocking-chair
without rocking?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your majesty," replied the fellow.</p>

<p>Whereupon the king signaled promptly the headsman.</p>
